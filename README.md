## What is Epicenter Design System?

Epicenter Design System is a collection of Vue 3 (and soon, React) components and styles for web apps.

This design system is being created for use in [Eric’s](https://www.ericpitcock.com) personal projects and serves as a training ground to stay current on best practices for creating inclusive and user-friendly experiences for all. Check out the Storybook at [epicenter.design](https://epicenter.design/?path=/story/intro--intro).

> Note: This is a work in progress and should be considered unstable. Don’t go tossing this in your mission-critical applications.
